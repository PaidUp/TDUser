## Reporting bugs and issues
Head over to [this repository's issues page](https://github.com/talosdigital/TDUser/issues), and
open a new one! It's very helpful if you specify as much as you can about the environment you're
working on, and the steps to reproduce the issue!

## Submitting a pull request
- Fork the repository and create a feature branch for your contribution.
- Run ``grunt test:server`` to check that all tests pass, prior to modifying anything.
- Install Packages ``npm install``.
- If applicable, document your changes in the [README](README.md). Use markdown to keep a neat
style. [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is a nice editor, check it out!
- Submit a pull request!
